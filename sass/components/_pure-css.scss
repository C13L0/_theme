// This theme uses sass/compass. Do not ever apply inline styles or directly edit anything in the css folder. Any and all work done outside of the "theme" folder will be overridden on compile. We wouldnt want you to loose all of your hard work, would we?

// Directions: Duplicate any pure css changes into this file and everyone will be happy! Do not worry, a themer will eventually find this file and put everything into the correct scss directory =)
